This is python exercise notebook from tutorial to introduce case studies on machine learning.

It introduces "hello-world" of python including functions on indention, import/from_import, list, tuple, set, dict, data type such as boolean, number, string, Integer; data structure as array and dataframe, loop as while loop, for loop; and how to connect with mysql, postgresql database.
It explains how to use libraryies like Numpy and pandas to create array, or regroup data frame.
Further, it gives axamples on the method to use python in ploting, and use python to crawl website.
Mainly several case studies in machine learning have been introduced e.g. popular regression as lineral regression, logit regression, bays regression, and machine learning of decision tree, random forest, K-means, and acessment method by ROC.
